# Connections (digital version)

### What is it?

A digital version of the board game [Connections (1991)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3370/connections) which was identical to the earlier ["Bridg-It"](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11052/bridg-it) game.


Bears a passing resemblance to these popularly known games:
- [Dots and boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_boxes)
- [Hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game))

This version will include a CPU player so you can play connections as a solo game:
- 1, 2, 3 move lookahead CPU
