# Box-In geometric proof

## Background: Basic Game Rules

### Sample BoxIn Play

### Basic terminology: squares + octogons = vertices + edges

### Types of vertices
- Leaf = connected to 1 other vertex
  - 4 orientations possible
- Stem = connected to 2 other vertices
  - 6 orientations possible
- Fork = connected to 3 other vertices
  - 4 orientations possible
- Star = connected to 4 other vertices
  - 1 orientation possible

## 1. Proof: Only 1 closed path allowed for any end game state

## 2. Proof: Any simple closed path satisfies V = E

## 3. Proof: Any simple open path satisfies V - E = 1

## 4. Proof: Any open path can be composed of any simple open path joined to another open path and still satisfies V - E = 1

## 5. Proof: Any closed path can be composed of any simple closed path joined to any open path and still satisfies V = E

# Conclusion: Any winning path will satisfy V = E, and therefore it must contain a simple closed path
